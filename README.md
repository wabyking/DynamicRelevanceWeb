# DynamicRelevanceWeb


This project is a Web Project Based on the Spring MVC, and the database is the MongoDb for store the document which is previously managed.
Different from other web project, our project have to call the native Eyetracker device and a native process for monitoring the data of users'eyes.
The monitor process is written by the C#, and have packed into a binary program. It can get the raw eye-tracking data and write these data into a native flie.


Other web functions are similary, like BootStrap for rapidly building the prototype and rich interaction by some Jquery code. Some trick like how to process the tag is conveniant for the tracking of the eye tracker.
